    "Abstraction in OOPs is the process of hiding complex implementation details of a system from its user, and only showing the necessary and essential details. It helps in reducing the complexity of the code and provides a simpler interface for the users to interact with.\n",

    "For example, consider a car. When we drive a car, we only need to know how to operate the steering wheel, pedals, and gears. We don't need to know how the engine works, how the fuel is burned, or how the power is transferred to the wheels. This is an example of abstraction in action. The complex details of the car's working are hidden from the driver, and only the necessary details are exposed through the car's interface.\n"

    "On the other hand, abstraction can be seen in the interface of the bank account. The user does not need to know how the balance is stored or how the transactions are processed. The user only needs to know how to use the methods provided by the account to perform the necessary actions."
