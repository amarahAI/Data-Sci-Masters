    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that specifies how software components should interact. APIs are used to allow different software systems to communicate with each other. An example of an API in real life is the Google Maps API, which allows third-party developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications."

RESTful web services use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. RESTful web services use URLs to identify resources and return responses in JSON or XML formats.\n",
