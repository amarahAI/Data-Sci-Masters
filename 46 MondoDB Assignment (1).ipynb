    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database system that stores data in a JSON-like format. It was developed by MongoDB Inc. Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, do not rely on the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Instead, they use document-based or key-value pairs to store data. Non-relational databases are preferred in scenarios where scalability and flexibility are important, and where data is constantly changing. In addition, non-relational databases are often used for storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data, logs, and sensor data.\n",

    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where a high degree of scalability and flexibility are required. It is also preferred for applications that require high performance for read and write operations, such as social media platforms and real-time data analytics systems."

    "MongoDB has the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-based: MongoDB stores data in a document format that is similar to JSON. This makes it easy to work with for developers who are familiar with JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable: MongoDB is designed to be horizontally scalable, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and high traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible data model: MongoDB supports dynamic schema design, which allows for flexibility in data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB supports replication and sharding, which ensures high availability and scalability of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexing to improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: MongoDB has a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to use: MongoDB has a simple and intuitive query language that makes it easy to work with for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source: MongoDB is open source software, which means that it is freely available and can be modified by anyone."
